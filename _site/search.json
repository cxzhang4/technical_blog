    "text": "This is a collection of various definitions of “statistics” and related terms.\n\n\n\n\n“… statistics is concerned with decision making in the face of uncertainty. Its applicability ranges from almost all inductive sciences to many situations that people face in everyday life when it is not perfectly obvious what they should do.”\nThey go on to describe two types of uncertainty. The first is due to randomness, given that one knows the laws of randomness that apply in a particular situation. The second is due to ignorance of the state of nature, i.e. of those laws of randomness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey equate “statistics” with “statistical inference”.\nThey delineate the three main challenges of statistical inference as follows:\n\nGeneralizing from sample to population\nGeneralizing from treatment to control group\nGeneralizing from observed measurements to the underlying constructs of interest\n\nAll three can be thought of as prediction problems."

    "text": "The probability integral transform states that, for a continuous random variable \\(X\\), the distribution of \\(F_X(X)\\) is \\(U(0, 1)\\). This result underlies inverse transform sampling. But why does this make sense?\n\nSuppose we have a random sample x from some unknown probability distribution. What does \\(F_X(x)\\) look like?\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s try to draw the density of \\(Y = F_X(x)\\) one section at a time.\nFirst, suppose we select the top 3% of the sample. By definition, this comprises the values between the \\(0.97\\) and \\(1\\) \\(p\\)-quantiles of this distribution.\n\n\n\nHere is the density of \\(X\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now, since we don’t know what the density of \\(Y = F_X(X)\\) looks like, let’s say it’s an arbitrary curve.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, since we selected the top 3% of the probability mass, we know that, within the orange interval, the area under the curve must be \\(0.03\\), and therefore the value of the density must be \\(1\\) on average.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, think about the region between the \\(0.97\\) and \\(0.98\\) p-quantiles of the sample. By definition, this comprises 1% of the probability mass (\\(0.98 - 0.97 = 0.01\\)), so we need to adjust our curve to satisfy this condition.\nHowever, we note that all intervals have this same property (even arbitrarily small intervals). It should be natural to suspect the density of curve of the CDF-transformed sample to be a horizontal line at \\(1\\): this is the only function I can think of that guarantees this property. It feels like this can be proven more formally using real analysis.\nLemma: For all real numbers \\(a, b\\) such that \\(0 \\leq a < b \\leq 1\\), \\(F_X(X) \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0, 1)\\).\nInformal mathematical argument:\nLet \\(a, b\\) be real number such that \\(0 \\leq a < b \\leq 1\\).\nBy the argument above, we have \\(F_Y(b) - F_Y(a) = b - a\\).\n(Note that we can rewrite this as \\(F(b) = b \\text{ and } F(a) = a\\), i.e. \\(F\\) is the identity.)\nWe have:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n  F_Y(b) - F_Y(a) &= b - a\\\\\n    &= F_Y(Y) \\Big|_a^b && \\text{(standard antiderivative notation)}\\\\\n    &= \\int_a^b f_Y(y)dy && \\text{(definition of a probability density function)}\\\\\n    &= \\int_a^b 1dy && \\text{(a function with the identity as its antiderivative)}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSo, we have \\(f_Y(y) = 1\\), and therefore, \\(Y = F_X(x)\\) has the standard uniform distribution."
