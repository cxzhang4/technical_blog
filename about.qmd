I'm a Master's student in Statistics and Data Science at LMU Munich. [My professional interests](https://carsonzhang.com/statement_of_interests) are some combination of statistics and computer science.

This blog draws a lot of inspiration from [Gregory Gundersen's blog](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/).
