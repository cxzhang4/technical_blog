I'm a master's student in Statistics and Data Science at LMU Munich. [My professional interests](https://carsonzhang.com/statement_of_interests) are some combination of statistics and computer science, and I strive to live up equally to the labels of statistician and computer scientist.

This blog draws a lot of inspiration from [Gregory Gundersen's blog](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/).
